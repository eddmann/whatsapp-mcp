[![Go 1.24+](https://img.shields.io/badge/go-1.24+-blue.svg)](https://golang.org/dl/)

## Overview

This MCP server provides 7 tools to interact with your WhatsApp account via the whatsmeow library:

- **list_chats** - List conversations with filtering, sorting, and pagination
- **list_messages** - Retrieve message history with date range filtering and context
- **search_messages** - Full-text search across all messages using SQLite FTS5 with context
- **send_message** - Send text and media messages with fuzzy name matching and reply/threading
- **download_media** - Download media files from conversations to local storage
- **get_connection_status** - Check WhatsApp connection status and database statistics
- **catch_up** - Intelligent activity summary showing recent chats, questions, and media

All messages and chats are persisted to a local SQLite database with full-text search capabilities, enabling rich queries and analysis of your WhatsApp history.

## Prerequisites

- Docker

## Installation & Setup

```bash
# Pull the image
docker pull ghcr.io/eddmann/whatsapp-mcp:latest
```

### First Run - WhatsApp Pairing

```bash
# Create directory for persistent storage
mkdir -p whatsapp-store

# Run the container (QR code will be displayed)
docker run -it --rm \
  -v "$(pwd)/whatsapp-store:/app/store" \
  ghcr.io/eddmann/whatsapp-mcp:latest
```

On first run, a QR code will be displayed in the terminal:

1. Open WhatsApp on your phone
2. Go to Settings → Linked Devices → Link a Device
3. Scan the QR code displayed in your terminal
4. Wait for history sync to complete (check logs for "history sync persisted messages count=...")

### Authentication & Data Storage

- Session Storage: WhatsApp session data is saved to `store/whatsapp.db` and persists across restarts
- Message Database: All messages and chats are stored in `store/messages.db` with FTS5 full-text search
- Media Downloads: Downloaded media files are organized in `store/<chatJID>/` directories
- No Re-Authentication: After initial pairing, the server automatically reconnects using stored credentials

> **Important:** Mount a volume to `/app/store` to persist session data and messages across container restarts.

## Usage

Ask Claude to interact with your WhatsApp data using natural language.

"Send a photo from ~/Desktop/photo.jpg to Bob"
"Send this audio recording to the Project Team group"
"Reply to that message from Sarah saying 'Sounds good!'"
```

> **Recipient Formats (with fuzzy name matching):**
>
> - Contact/group names: `"John"`, `"Bob"`, `"Project Team"` (searches your chat history)
> - Phone numbers: Without `+` (e.g., `447123456789`)
> - Full JID: `447123456789@s.whatsapp.net` for contacts, `123456@g.us` for groups
>
> If multiple matches are found for a name, you'll be prompted to disambiguate using the full JID.

> **Message Threading:**
>
> Reply to specific messages to create threaded conversations. The original message will be quoted in your reply.
